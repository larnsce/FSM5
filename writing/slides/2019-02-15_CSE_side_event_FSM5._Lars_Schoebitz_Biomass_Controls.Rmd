# Safely Managed Sanitation Services 

???

I want to talk to you a bit about safely managed sanitation services, which ultimately is FSM and what we like to all sparky in 2030.

# In 2015

> Estimates for safely managed sanitation were available for 84 countries. <sup>1</sup>

# Faecal sludge treatment - Take a guess

For how many of the 84 countries was data on **"excreta emptied and treated offsite"** available.

In other words: How many countries with data on the effectiveness of faecal sludge treatment?

# Why so many 0's?

In the absence of data and if offsite sanitation is the dominant part (> 50% with piped sewers), the percentage of faecal sludge treated at a faecal sludge treatment plant is assumed to be 0.

# Wastewater treatment data

- Some data sources for wastewater treatment are open, structured and accessible
- These include:
  - [Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/waterbase-uwwtd-urban-waste-water-treatment-directive-5)
  - [OECD data](https://data.oecd.org/water/waste-water-treatment.htm)
- For other countries data is available through utilities and JMP data drive

> Incomplete data on excreta management in on-site systems is the most challenging data gap for monitoring Target 6.2. <sup>1</sup>


> Data leads to better decisions and better policies. It helps us create goals and measure progress. It enables advocacy and accountability. <sup>2</sup>

# Faecal sludge treatment data

- Data sources are "hidden, unstructured and not accessible"
- Currently no standards against which "safe treatment" could be measured.

???

  - Utilities
  - Governments
  - Private sector actors
  - Scientists
- There are currently no standards against which "safe treatment" could be measured.

---
# Opportunity

- Faecal sludge laboratories (**add info/logo**)
- SFD Promotion Initiative
- Engineering Field Testing Platforms
- Smart City Initiatives (Sensor data)
- Emerging ISO PC318 Standard
- Gates Open Research Platform
- Collaboration with utilities
- Private sector actors
- many, many other sources

???

- All of these will or do already generate significant amounts of data, that if structurd and centralised could support filling the data gap for SDG 6.2.1.
- Faecal sludge laboratories will likely standard methods for analysis of samples.
- Is anyone working on standards for data entry, documentation, storage and potentially sharing?

---
# How?

**Share your data publically**

1. Publish data, for example on [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). 
2. Follow [FAIR Data Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
    - Findable
    - Accessible
    - Interoperable
    - Reusable
3. Develop data standards. (**Chat to Lindsey Noakes from Gather**)

.footnote[The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. [Nature Comment.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)]

---
# How?

**Establish a centralised open source data repository**

1. Introduce controlled data vocabularies.
2. Write open source scripts.
3. Make data queryable (e.g. [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)). 
4. Develop version controlled (i.e. git) software.
5. Host and govern data in a centralised open source **Faecal sludge data repository** (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/))

SQL Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS)

# ETL pipeline

> In computing, extract, transform, load (ETL) is the general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source(s). <sup>1</sup>

--

- The source is you.
- The transformations are the application of agreed upon standards.
- Data is stored openly as a public good, so that it can be "loaded" by anyone.
